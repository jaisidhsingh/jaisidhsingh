## Hi there 👋

I am an incoming MS in Machine Learning Student at the University of Tuebingen. I graduated with my B.Tech in AI and Data Science from <a href="https://iitj.ac.in/">IIT Jodhpur</a> in 2024.

🔭 I work on a wide range of machine learning and deep learning problems. Specifically, I am most interested in robust <span style="color: salmon">vision-language reasoning and understanding</span> through <span style="color: seagreen">handcrafted algorithmic improvements as well as scaling up model capacity</span>. Besides this, my research and interests also touch upon <span style="color: blueviolet">interpretability and responsible AI</span>.
