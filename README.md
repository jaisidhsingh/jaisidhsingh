## Hi there 👋

I am a final-year undergraduate student at <a href="https://iitj.ac.in/">IIT Jodhpur</a> majoring in <a>AI and Data Science</a>

🔭 I work on a wide range of machine learning and deep learning problems. Specifically, I am most interested in robust <span style="color: salmon">vision-language reasoning and understanding</span> through <span style="color: seagreen">handcrafted algorithmic improvements as well as scaling up model capacity</span>. Besides this, my research and interests also touch upon <span style="color: blueviolet">interpretability and responsible AI</span>.
